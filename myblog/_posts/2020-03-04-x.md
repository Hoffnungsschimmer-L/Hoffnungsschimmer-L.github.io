-So reinforcement learning in POMDPs is hard.  Like, super hard.  <br>
-Actually planning in POMDPs is formally undecidable in the sense that if I give you a POMDP and ask:<br>
-"is this the optimal first action to take from this belief state?"<br>
â€”If you could solve that problem you could solve the halting problem.<br>
<br>
-Wait, wait a minute.  That has profound implications.  <br>
-Because we're human beings running around in the world.  we're living in a POMDP because we can't know everything.<br>
-So you are telling me that even if I could relive life an infinite number of times I still don't know what the right thing to do is.  <br>
-You're saying that life is unknowable.  It's undecidable you can never know what to do.<br>
