许多年里我似乎都被包裹在一种nothingness当中。<br>
尽管看着好像不是这样：对世界无尽又坚决的好奇，那种撞了南墙也要找找看梯子和狗洞的执着。<br>
But it’s really like I’m on the other side of the world, interacting with everything and everyone through a screen.  I can be heard and seen but not touched.  <br>
I live in a completely different plane,  and I seem to be the only one on it.   <br> 
<br>
People in the ”real world” only see a projection of me, or a mask that I put on.<br>
I always feel the need to wear some kind of mask around people.  <br>
    (“if I were to babble what’s really on my mind about, most of them would just be startled and wonder what’s wrong.”<br>
    (I find it much easier to just do what everyone else do in social environment.  <br>
And I have so many of them, personality masks.  <br>
I guess that’s the real reason why some people find me so complicated and mysterious.  It’s like trying to reconstruct data in high-dimensional vector space with only one or two random projections.  It’s bound to fail.  <br>
<br>
I’m just watching the world through a screen.  I see people laughing, crying, connecting.  <br>
Some of my alternate personalities even tried to blend in: to love, to cry, to connect.  (What a Kitsch.    <br>
Yet still I don’t get it.  <br>
I see them, I talk to them, I play with them.<br>
Still I don’t get it.  <br>
<br>
But I was fine with it.  (for a very long time anyways.  <br>
<br>
Until there came a day that someone dragged a huge chunk of me across.  <br>
And for a moment I was there, laughing, crying, connected, loved.<br>
In that moment I real thought I made it across.<br>
But deep down in my heart, I still have that sense of an outsider.  <br>
The rest of me that’s left behind is crawling and screaming, yelling for me to wake the fk up.<br>
<br>
Then I did.<br>
I was alone again.<br>
<br>
Detachment.  <br>
归属感的缺乏。<br>
<br>
大概我从小就是比较复杂的人吧。<br>
Never really identified with most people.  Always there’s a sense of detachment from the rest of world, no matter who I’m with, friends or lovers, I am always alone deep down.  <br>
朋友说也许是de-attachment that came from the subconscious mind。Idk，我是不觉得自己在主动的建起隔离墙的。<br>
<br>
但就是这样，坐在银幕一端，看余下世界的悲欢离合。<br>
只要他们不跳出银幕来尝试拉我进去，I can still lead on an amazingly depressed yet peaceful life.  <br>
那场half-way across的经历产生了许多无法再触摸到他人的痛苦纠结。<br>
<br>
曾经我觉得，也许我就是不一样的那一个。接受孤独本身，而不再去想消灭它，它反而resembles to a source of strength.  <br>
But who am I kidding? Wanting to connect is probably in the god damn human nature.  <br>
不过仍然，我应该留在自己的plane上。钻进其他世界的尝试只会让自己变得unbalanced and distorted。<br>
I was alone again, but I was also home. <br>
<br>

长久以来我都习惯于和「理性思维」内核的人打交道。一种让我觉得更简单明了和舒适的沟通方式吧。<br>
但诚然，哪怕我觉得可爱如机器人的一些理科朋友，也总在许多问题上惊人的独断+cynical（Rationally open-minded 背后所依存的理性价值至上?<br>
<br>
你看，割裂感。<br>
<br>
当然与朋友知己之间的关系，并不需要对方和我的每个aspect都能click。每一个想要表达的想法都能有合适的沟通对象就很好了。<br>
一方面是并不奢求有人和我有同样复杂以及同样composition的思维世界。<br>
另一方面，其实在不同的area都能找到比我对它更熟悉了解的人。能不断扩展出新的想法，是比两个能相互理解但不能给出new idea就在那里嗯嗯啊啊的状态要有趣多了吧。<br>
<br>
他们看见的我也许是接近真实的。<br>
我的某一面被完整的投射在他们面前。尽管仍然是被缩限成这一面的我。<br>
但他们至少看见了这部分的真实，而不是some leaned personality mask.<br>
于我来说大概已经是最接近soulmate的存在了吧<br>
<br>
但我仍然感觉像住在一个bubble room, hugging people with a plastic layer keeping us apart.  <br>
<br>
<br>
那什么才是本体呢？<br>
什么样的连结才算得上是真正本体的关系呢？或者这样的连结真的存在么？<br>
<br>
当然不会是奇怪小众兴趣小组。其实也不是什么世界观价值观。<br>
仍然让人觉得太表面了，都太表面了。<br>
