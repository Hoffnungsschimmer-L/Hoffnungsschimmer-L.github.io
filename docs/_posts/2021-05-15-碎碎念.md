焦虑。从前是没有这样的感觉的。那种浮躁慌张，不知道一切是什么样子的感觉。<br>
 <br>
那天开车时突然想到，从前在脑中是有个模型运行模拟着其他物体的轨迹的。但现在好像看不见那个系统了，眼前只剩下关注中心的车辆。不知道是重庆道路上车辆太多让我无暇顾及其他，放弃了这种意义不大的estimation；还是那之后大脑运行能力真的退化了。<br>
就有些恐慌吧。想到以前从是没有这种慌张，也不会有什么真正的害怕的。<br>
 <br>
以前会因为巨大的环境变化而恐慌么，会因为政策手续繁琐而焦虑么。They were always so clear to me. Everything seems to be too complicated now.  Yet that's the way this world is, no?<br>
I was so up to be prepared for everything, to think about every possibility and things that might be needed.  What changed?  How'd I become so passive about everything? When did I start to wanting to run from everything? It's like the auto-response of my mind to anything has been changed to "avoid if possible at all". <br>
 <br>
从前不是这样的。<br>
I mean there were times that I run away from dealing with miscellaneous things, but never like this. 嘛。<br>
那种下意识的逃避，有时会觉得是不是自己不得不给退化中的大脑节省下些CPU呢。So I'm just gonna become an idiot like everyone else who does not have enough brain to think and process everything?<br>
 <br>
又能怎么样呢，最近好像也只能在每一次逃避的冲动前默默和自己讲，<br>
Don't run,it's only gonna make it worse.<br>
Do not try to avoid anything.<br>
Its not the attitude you should have in facing everything in life.<br>
You were such a brave and determined girl. <br>
Be that self again will ya?<br>
有的时候觉得难以想象，曾经我竟拥有那么大的勇气和力量而不自知。还是悄悄希望，只是depression 的span和惯性模糊了这个innner logic：面对才会得到best result possible。<br>
