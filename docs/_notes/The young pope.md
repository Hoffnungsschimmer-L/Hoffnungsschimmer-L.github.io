Esther, <br>
I love God because it is so painful to love human beings. <br>
I love a God that never leaves or that always leaves me. <br>
God, the absence of God... <br>
Always reassuring and definitive. <br>
<br>
I am a priest, <br>
I have renounced my fellow man, my fellow women, <br>
because I don't want to suffer, <br>
because I'm incapable of withstanding the heartbreak of love, <br>
because I'm unhappy, like all priests. <br>
<br>
It would be wonderful to love you the way you want to be loved, <br>
but it's not possible. <br>
Because I am not a man. I am a coward. <br>
I am a coward. Like all priests. <br>
<br>

<br>
Friendly relationships are dangerous. <br>
They lead themselves to ambiguities, misunderstandings, and conflicts, and they always end badly. <br>
<br>
Formal relationships, on the other hand, are as clear as spring water. <br>
Their rules are carved in stone. <br>
There's no risk of being misunderstood and they last forever. <br>
<br>
Now you need to know... <br>
I do not like appreciate friendly relationships. <br>
But I'm a great admire of formal ones. <br>
Where there are formal relationships there are rites and where there are rites the earth order reigns.<br>
<br>

<br>
It's difficult, for a saint, to answer all the questions of humanity.<br>
